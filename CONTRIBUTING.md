## 🎬 Getting started

Contributions are made to this project using Issues and Pull Request (PRs). Before creating your own, search for existing Issues and PRs - as I'm sure you're aware, this removes duplication and makes everyone's life easier!

### 😭 Issues

Issues should be used to report bugs, proposing new features before a PR is raised, and to request new features. We're making use of templates to make this process easier for you and consistent for everyone - this will appear when you create an issue.

If you find an issue that has already been reported by another good samaritan, then please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Reacting to issues can also help our maintainers understand that the issue is affecting more than one reporter.

### 🎫 Pull Requests

Pull Requests (PRs) are always welcome.

The preferred way to contribute to this project is to fork the main repository on Github and then submit a pull request.

#### 🤔 Making a pull request

Before a PR can be merged, two core developers need to approve it. It may be the case that you have an incomplete contribution, where you're expecting to do more work before receiving a full review, and these should have the prefix `[WIP]` - this will indicate to everyone that it is a work in progress ticket and will avoid duplicated work. These types of PRs often benefit from including a task list in the PR description.

It's important to do the following, and the PR template that you'll see will ask you explicitly:

* Give your pull request a helpful title which summarizes what your contribution does.

* Ensure that your code is documented and commented, and that the documentation renders properly.
