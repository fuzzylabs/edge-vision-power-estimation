# Power Consumption Modelling

This package trains layer-specific models for power consumption and runtime.

## Data

TODO: bring real data from Jetson Orin Nano

_Currently, `data/` contains dummy data generated by `dummy_data.ipynb`_

## Models

`model` module contains common code for modelling layers' power consumption and runtime, as well as pre-defined pipelines for the following layer types:

- Convolutional 2D
- Dense
- Pooling 2D

## Usage

`train.ipynb` shows how the pipelines can be trained and used
